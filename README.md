## Instructions

13.6 (Tip Calculator Modification) The Tip Calculator app from Section 12.5 does not need a Button to perform its calculations.
Re-implement this app to use property listeners to perform the calculations whenever the user modifies the bill amount or changes the custom tip percentage.
Also use a property binding to update the Label that displays the tip percentage.
